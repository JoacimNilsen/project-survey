My second project in React, creating a simple survey wich ends up in a summary. I was going to make it all in one page at first with a submit button to render the results because i thought it would be to hard to do individual renders per question. Turns out this worked perfectly fine. The time for this project did not allow me to break things in to smaller components because now I have to another project to start on. If i got time in the near future I will revisit this and do so.
